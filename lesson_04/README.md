# TODO

- Why when we have to update a data, we have to take from _id to id?

# Check
- Whether you can pass data without any  required input

```
const { v4: uuid } = require('uuid');
```

[Note: HEre we get v4 as destructure from uuid and then we call it uuid otherthan v4]

- Dotenv files are something we need in our server but we don't want it in our github
